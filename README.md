# Pegasus3D

Pegasus3D is that printer you build when every other printer just keeps letting you down  
It doesn’t care about RGB lights or looking flashy on YouTube builds  
It just wants to print good stuff and keep doing that all day, no tantrums, no drama  

Built from scratch with a bunch of love, late-night trial-and-error, and a little too much caffeine  
It’s clean, reliable, and lowkey built like a tank  
No flex, no noise, no "surprise spaghetti" moments

## how it started

This all started ‘cause I got real tired of fixing other printers mid-print  
Belts slipping, z-wobble, janky firmware, all of it  
So I cracked open Fusion, made a fresh new file, and decided I was gonna build one that didn’t suck  

No recycled frames or salvaged rails  
Just a clean build from scratch that actually made sense  
One axis at a time, each bracket tested and tweaked until it stopped annoying me  
The bed stays level, the motion is smooth, and the whole thing feels like it knows what it’s doing  

And yeah it took forever  
But worth

## what makes it good (like really good)

Pegasus3D is lowkey cracked  
First of all, that frame? The render says it all  

None of that flimsy open-frame junk  
This thing is boxed in, rigid as hell, and everything bolts up perfect  
Dual linear rails keep that gantry riding smooth like it's floating  
Stepper placement is clean, and everything has room to move without feeling crowded  
Even the display is mounted dead center, tucked but visible, no awkward poking-out weirdness

I didn’t just slap parts on and hope  
Everything’s placed like it’s meant to be there  
Belt tensioning is actually good (finally)  
And even tho it’s just a render, you can already feel the print quality is gonna hit different

## more pics coming soon

Once this thing is fully built IRL, I’m gonna be throwing pics of prints, failed prints, mods, and probably one or two accidental meltdowns here  
But for now, the render tells enough of the story  
You can already tell this isn’t some wobbly IKEA-style printer

## license or whatever

MIT License  
You can fork this, remix it, sell it, whatever  
Just don’t take my work, slap your name on it, and pretend you were "inspired by nature" or something  
Build cool stuff, give credit, and don’t be a gatekeeper  
Be chill
